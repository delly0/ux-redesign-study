# ux-redesign-study

This project is based on a user experience project in a real-world context. The project consists of 3 interconnected parts: (1) a research proposal; (2) a report to present research findings; (3) a usability and user experience evaluation of a technology prototype. Modelling real-world user experience practice, the project is communicated through a presentation, report, and video.

This user experience (UX) redesign project focused on improving the usability and emotional appeal of an upcoming application. Through research-driven design thinking, I proposed a refined version of the app interface based on user pain points and interaction flow issues.
